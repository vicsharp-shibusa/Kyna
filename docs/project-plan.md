# Kyna Project Plan

Kyna is a pet project and not directly revenue generating, so I plan to keep my day job; and of course, my day job will take priority over this project.

That said, my plan is to work most early mornings on the project and some evenings and Saturdays. Time has to be split between doing the work of the project and editing/publishing the videos of the work.

## TODO List

1. EodHistoricalData.com (2 weeks)
   1. Game plan - review results from API.
   2. Configuration.
   3. API request/response DB work.
   4. Mapping responses to the Kyna domain.
   5. Splits - normalizing price action and volume.
   6. Price Action - preserving price actions to build charts.
2. Charts (1 week)
   1. Performance - fetching charts in less than 50ms (stretch goal of less than 5 ms).
3. Moving Averages (1 week)
4. Relative Strength Index (1 week)
5. Investor's Business Daily Market Direction (1 week)
6. Sentiment and Trend (3 week)

## Completed

1. Logging prototype. Tag: v0.1.
2. Standardized CLI argument handling and general process flow - example in Kyna.Prototype.Cli. Tag: v0.1.1.
